### Project overview & goal:

The main goal of the project is to develop a personal training software with implemented personal trainer (PT) to client tools. This will be achieved via a piece of software delivered through the medium of a website where a user can sign up and create an account. Moreover, the website will have information on nutrition, training, a personal trainer page and their GDPR rights. The main home page holds general information about the webpage, it’s purpose and what each section covers. The nutrition section aims to educate users on calories, macros, weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance, supplements, vitamins and MyFitnessPal. Furthermore, the training section aims to guide users in the training ventures and inform them on various training styles. The nutrition and training information can be used by PT’s as a guideline and reference to use for clients as well as drawing in more users and clients. Finally, when a user creates an account and signs up, they can either chose to create a personal trainer account or client account. Depending on the account type they will have different home page’s and be able to do different things.
